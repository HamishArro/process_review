- school reports company

* they help teachers find out how students have done on tests
* string of comma seperated values with test scores from schools,
* they would like a simple program that finds the students grades.

string example -> test scores ranging from 1- 100
"1,10,45,60,80,100" -> "Green: 2\nAmber: 1\nRed: 3"

All integers
Green : 75 - 100
Amber : 50 - 74
Red : 0 - 49

if no values entered expect "No results given"

## Post review

- It was recommended to learn how to use scripts and I have used this repo to do so.
